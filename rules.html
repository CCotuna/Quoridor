                    <h4>Rules of the game</h4>
                    <h5><b>Quoridor</b> is played on a game board of <b>81 square spaces</b> (9x9). Each <b>player</b> is represented by a <b>pawn</b> which begins at the center space of one edge of the board (in a two-player game, the pawns begin opposite each other). The <b>objective</b> is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the <b>opposite side</b> of the game board from which it begins.</h5>
                    <h5>The distinguishing characteristic of Quoridor is its <b>twenty walls</b>. Walls are flat two-space-wide pieces which can be placed in the groove that runs between the spaces. Walls block the path of all pawns, which must go around them. The walls are divided equally among the players at the start of the game, and once placed, cannot be moved or removed. On a turn, a player may either move their pawn, or, if possible, place a wall.</h5>
                    <h5>Pawns can be moved to <b>any space</b> at a right angle (but not diagonally). If adjacent to another pawn, the pawn may jump over that pawn. If that square is not accessible (e.g., off the edge of the board or blocked by a third pawn or a wall), the player may move to either space that is immediately adjacent (left or right) to the first pawn. Multiple pawns may not be jumped. Walls may not be jumped, including when moving laterally due to a pawn or wall being behind a jumped pawn.</h5>
                    <h5>Walls can be placed directly between two spaces, in any groove not already occupied by a wall. However, a wall may not be placed which cuts off the only remaining path of any pawn to the side of the board it must reach.</h5>
                    <h5>Though it can be played with 3 players, <b>it's advised against</b>. Since the 3rd player doesn't have player on the opposite side, they have an <b>advantage</b>.</h5>
